# About HTML
**HTML is used to create web pages that start by writing down the words you want to appear on your page. You then add tags or elements to the words so
that the browser knows what is a heading or where a paragraph begins and ends**


# CSS
**CSS uses rules to enable you to control the styling and layout
of web pages. We then go on to look at the wide variety of CSS
properties you can use in your CSS rules. These properties generally fall into one of two categories**

a document might start witha large heading, followed by an introduction or the most important information.
