# About Links
**Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing**
1. Links are created using the <a> element**
2. You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to
3. If you are linking to a page within your own site, it isbest to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
4. You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

## More Info About Links
- Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag.

example: \<a href="site url" > Title </a>


- The text between the opening <a> tag and closing </a> tag is known as link text

- Users can click on anything that appears between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag and will be taken to the page specified in the href attribut

- Every page and every image on a website has a URL (or Uniform Resource Locator). The URL is made up of the domain name followed by the path to that page or image.

## Relative URLs
- itcan be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.

- If you link to the same page from two different pages you might, therefore, need to write two different relative URLs.

example;

```

To link to the homepage from the music reviews:
<a href="../index.html">Home</a>


To link to music listings from the homepage:
<a href="music/listings.html">Listings</a>


```

# Email Links
To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the <a> element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to. 

\<a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon</a
