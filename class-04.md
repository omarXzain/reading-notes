# About Links
**Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing**
1. Links are created using the <a> element
2. You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to
3. If you are linking to a page within your own site, it isbest to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
4. You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

## More Info About Links
- Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag.

example: \<a href="site url" > Title </a>


- The text between the opening <a> tag and closing </a> tag is known as link text

- Users can click on anything that appears between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag and will be taken to the page specified in the href attribut

- Every page and every image on a website has a URL (or Uniform Resource Locator). The URL is made up of the domain name followed by the path to that page or image.

## Relative URLs
- itcan be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.

![](https://www.87android.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/absolut-relative-url-html.png)

- If you link to the same page from two different pages you might, therefore, need to write two different relative URLs.

example;

```

To link to the homepage from the music reviews:
<a href="../index.html">Home</a>


To link to music listings from the homepage:
<a href="music/listings.html">Listings</a>


```

# Email Links
To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the <a> element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to. 

\<a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon</a

## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function.

Example
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
Before the closing </body>
tag, you can see the link to the
JavaScript file. The JavaScript
file starts with a variable used
to hold a new message, and is
followed by a function called
updateMessage().
<ti t l e>Basic Function</title>
<l i nk rel ="stylesheet" href="css/ c03.css" />
</head>
<body>
<hl>TravelWorthy</ hl>
<div id="message">We lcome to our site! </ div>
<script src="js/ basic-function .js"></script>
</ body>
</ html> 

```
