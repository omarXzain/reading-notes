# About Lists
- There are lots of ways when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:

1. \<ol> Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered
2. \<ul> Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
3. \<li> item in the list is placed between an opening \<li> tag and a closing \</li> tag.

4. \<dl> The definition list is created with the \<dl> element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
5. \<dt> This is used to contain the term being defined.
6. \<dd> This is used to contain the definition.

## Abour \<ol> and \<ul>
- Ordered lists use numbers.
